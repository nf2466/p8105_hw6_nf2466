### Problem 1

Create a city\_state variable (e.g. “Baltimore, MD”), and a binary
variable indicating whether the homicide is solved. Omit cities Dallas,
TX; Phoenix, AZ; and Kansas City, MO – these don’t report victim race.
Also omit Tulsa, AL – this is a data entry mistake. For this problem,
limit your analysis those for whom victim\_race is white or black. Be
sure that victim\_age is numeric.

Read in the data

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv", na = c("", "NA", "Unknown")) %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
    resolution = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ 0,
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ 0,
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ 1)
  ) %>% 
  filter(
    victim_race %in% c("White", "Black"),
    city_state != "Tulsa, AL") %>% 
  select(city_state, resolution, victim_age, victim_race, victim_sex)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_double(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

For the city of Baltimore, MD, the adjusted odds ratio for solving
homicides comparing non-white victims to white victims keeping all other
variables fixed is 1.363 (95% CI 0.975-1.907) which is not statistically
significant.

``` r
baltimore_df =
  homicide_df %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD")

glm(resolution ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, 
    data = baltimore_df,
    family = binomial()) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  mutate(
    OR = exp(estimate),
    CI_lower = exp(estimate - 1.96 * std.error),
    CI_upper = exp(estimate + 1.96 * std.error)
  ) %>% 
  select(term, OR, starts_with("CI")) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

| term              |    OR | CI\_lower | CI\_upper |
| :---------------- | ----: | --------: | --------: |
| (Intercept)       | 1.363 |     0.975 |     1.907 |
| victim\_age       | 0.993 |     0.987 |     1.000 |
| victim\_raceWhite | 2.320 |     1.648 |     3.268 |
| victim\_sexMale   | 0.426 |     0.325 |     0.558 |

Now run glm for each of the cities in your dataset, and extract the
adjusted odds ratio (and CI) for solving homicides comparing Black
victims to white victims. Do this within a “tidy” pipeline, making use
of purrr::map, list columns, and unnest as necessary to create a
dataframe with estimated ORs and CIs for each city.

``` r
models_results_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  nest(data = -city_state) %>% 
  mutate(
    models = map(.x = data, ~glm(resolution ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, data = .x, family = binomial())),
    results = map(models, broom::tidy)
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, results) %>% 
  unnest(results) %>% 
  mutate(
    OR = exp(estimate),
    CI_lower = exp(estimate - 1.96 * std.error),
    CI_upper = exp(estimate + 1.96 * std.error)
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, term, OR, starts_with("CI")) 
```

This plot shows that New York, NY has the lowest odds (less than 1) of
solving a homicide for males compared to females will be resolved by
arrest, when adjusting race, and sex, whereas Albuquerque, NM has the
highest odds of solving a homicide for males compared to females when
adjusting for the same variables. However, neither of them are
statistically significant since the 95% CI crosses 1.

``` r
models_results_df %>% 
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale") %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, OR)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = OR)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = CI_lower, ymax = CI_upper)) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```

## Problem 2

Load and clean the data for regression analysis (i.e. convert numeric to
factor where appropriate, check for missing data, etc.).

``` r
baby_df = 
  read_csv("data/birthweight.csv", na = c("", "NA", "Unknown"))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

Propose a regression model for birthweight. This model may be based on a
hypothesized structure for the factors that underly birthweight, on a
data-driven model-building process, or a combination of the two.
Describe your modeling process and show a plot of model residuals
against fitted values – use add\_predictions and add\_residuals in
making this plot.

Compare your model to two others:

One using length at birth and gestational age as predictors (main
effects only) One using head circumference, length, sex, and all
interactions (including the three-way interaction) between these Make
this comparison in terms of the cross-validated prediction error; use
crossv\_mc and functions in purrr as appropriate.

Note that although we expect your model to be reasonable, model building
itself is not a main idea of the course and we don’t necessarily expect
your model to be “optimal”. Find some residuals

``` r
baby_df = 
  read_csv("./data/birthweight.csv")%>%
  mutate(
    babysex = case_when(
      babysex == "1" ~ "male",
      babysex == "2" ~ "female"),
    smoken = case_when(
      smoken == 0 ~ 0,
      smoken > 0 ~ 1
    ),
   id = row_number()
  )
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

Propose a regression model for birthweight:

Initially, I proposed that a mother’s prepregnancy GMI, weight gain
during pregnancy, and smoking status would all be important variables to
include into my model. However, we see that there is a left skew of the
residuals, which led me to believe that there may be other variables in
the dataset that are important to include in my model.

``` r
model_test = 
  lm(bwt ~ ppbmi + wtgain + smoken, data = baby_df)

model_test_df = 
  baby_df %>%
  modelr::add_residuals(model_test)

model_test_plot = 
  model_test_df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = resid)) + 
  geom_density()
```

I then hypothesized that gestational age would be an important
covariate, since birthweight should be directly correlated with how far
along a pregnancy is before delivery. I used a residual v. predictor
plot to test this hypothesis and it looked like there was a linea
relationship between residuals of my initial model and predictions in a
model between birthweigt and gestational age.

``` r
model_ga = 
  lm(bwt ~ gaweeks, data = baby_df)

model_test_df %>%
  modelr::add_predictions(model_ga)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x= pred, y = resid)) +
  geom_point()
```

<img src="p8105_hw6_nf2466_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="90%" />

I then proposed that mother’s prepregnancy BMI, weight gain during
pregnancy, smoking status AND gestational age affects birthweight. The
residual plot of this model was more symmetrical around 0 (with a mild
left skew).

``` r
model_1_fit = lm(bwt ~ ppbmi + wtgain + smoken + gaweeks, data = baby_df)


model_1_df = 
  baby_df %>% 
  modelr::add_residuals(model_1_fit)%>%
  mutate(
    model = "model_one"
  )%>%
  select(model, id, bwt, resid)

  model_1_df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = resid)) + 
  geom_density()
```

<img src="p8105_hw6_nf2466_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="90%" />

Fit model with length at birth and gestation age model

``` r
model_2_fit = lm(bwt ~ gaweeks + blength, data = baby_df)

model_2_df =
  baby_df %>% 
  modelr::add_residuals(model_2_fit) %>%
  mutate(
    model = "model_two"
  )%>%
  select(model, id, bwt, resid)

model_2_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = resid)) + 
  geom_density()
```

<img src="p8105_hw6_nf2466_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="90%" />

Fit model with head circumference, length, sex, and all interactions

``` r
model_3_fit = lm(bwt ~ bhead * blength * babysex, data = baby_df)

model_3_df = 
  baby_df %>% 
  modelr::add_residuals(model_3_fit) %>%
  mutate(
    model = "model_three"
  )%>%
  select(model, id, bwt, resid)

model_3_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = resid)) + 
  geom_density()
```

<img src="p8105_hw6_nf2466_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="90%" />

Now perform cross validation of the three models

``` r
cv_df = 
  crossv_mc(baby_df, 100) 

cv_df =
  cv_df %>% 
  mutate(
    train = map(train, as_tibble),
    test = map(test, as_tibble))

cv_df = 
  cv_df %>% 
  mutate(
    model_one  = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ ppbmi + wtgain + smoken + gaweeks, data = .x)),
    model_two  = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ gaweeks + blength, data = .x)),
    model_three  = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ bhead * blength * babysex, data = .x))) %>% 
  mutate(
    rmse_model_one = map2_dbl(model_one, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
    rmse_model_two = map2_dbl(model_two, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
    rmse_model_three = map2_dbl(model_three, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)))

cv_df %>% 
  select(starts_with("rmse")) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    everything(),
    names_to = "model", 
    values_to = "rmse",
    names_prefix = "rmse_") %>% 
  mutate(model = fct_inorder(model)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = model, y = rmse)) + geom_violin()
```

<img src="p8105_hw6_nf2466_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="90%" />

From our plot, we see that model three (birthweight predicted by head
circumference, body legnth, sex and its interactions) is the best fitted
model of the three that were proposed.
